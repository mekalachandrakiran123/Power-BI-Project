# Power-BI-Project
## Customer Churn Analysis using Power BI
### Project Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge for telecom companies, as acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones.
This project uses Power BI to analyze customer behavior, identify churn patterns, and provide actionable insights to reduce customer attrition.

The analysis transforms raw customer data into interactive dashboards that help understand why customers leave, who is most at risk, and what actions can improve retention.
